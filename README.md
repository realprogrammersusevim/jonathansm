# jonathansm.com

This is the code for my website currently hosted at
[jonathansm.com](https://jonathansm.com). The whole site is built into two
files: a binary with the compiled Rust code with some embedded files and
templates, and a read-only SQLite file with the site content that's made in
another repo.
